# Apple Silicon ARM64 Workflow Adaptations

This document summarizes the changes made to adapt the Fuego workflow for macOS Apple Silicon ARM64.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated macOS Workflow (`.github/workflows/macOS.yml`)

- **Updated macOS runners**: Changed from `macos-12` to `macos-13` for better ARM64 support
- **Enhanced build configuration**: Added Apple Silicon specific CMake configuration
- **Improved architecture detection**: Added proper `CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR` and `ARCH` settings
- **Updated minimum macOS version**: Set to 11.0 for Apple Silicon builds (vs 10.12 for Intel)

### 2. Enhanced ARM64 Configuration (`arm.cmake`)

- **Apple Silicon detection**: Added `APPLE_SILICON` flag for Apple Silicon specific optimizations
- **Advanced ARM64 optimizations**: Added support for ARMv8.5-a with Apple Silicon specific features:
  - `fp16` (half-precision floating point)
  - `rcpc` (Release Consistent Processor Consistent)
  - `dotprod` (dot product instructions)
  - `crypto` (cryptographic instructions)
- **Apple Silicon tuning**: Added `-mtune` flags for Apple M1, M2, M3, and M4 processors
- **Fallback support**: Graceful fallback to basic ARMv8-a features if advanced features aren't supported

### 3. Build Process Improvements

- **Architecture-specific builds**: Separate build configurations for Intel and Apple Silicon
- **Optimized compiler flags**: Apple Silicon specific `-march` and `-mtune` flags
- **Better error handling**: Improved CMake configuration with proper architecture detection

## Key Features

### Apple Silicon Optimizations
- **ARMv8.5-a support**: Utilizes latest ARM64 features available on Apple Silicon
- **Processor-specific tuning**: Optimized for Apple M1/M2/M3/M4 processors
- **Crypto acceleration**: Enables hardware cryptographic instruction support
- **SIMD optimizations**: Enhanced vector processing capabilities

### Compatibility
- **Backward compatibility**: Maintains support for Intel x86_64 builds
- **Graceful fallbacks**: Falls back to basic ARMv8-a if advanced features aren't available
- **Cross-platform**: Works on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs

## Testing

A test script (`test_apple_silicon_cmake.sh`) has been created to verify the CMake configuration works correctly for Apple Silicon ARM64 builds.

## Usage

The workflow will automatically:
1. Detect the target architecture (Intel vs Apple Silicon)
2. Apply appropriate compiler optimizations
3. Build with architecture-specific flags
4. Create properly optimized binaries for each platform

## Benefits

- **Better performance**: Apple Silicon specific optimizations provide better performance on M-series chips
- **Hardware acceleration**: Utilizes Apple Silicon's crypto and SIMD capabilities
- **Native ARM64 support**: True native ARM64 builds without Intel emulation
- **Future-proof**: Ready for upcoming Apple Silicon processors
