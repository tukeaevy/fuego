## ✨ DYNAMIC UPDATES INCLUDED

### 🔥 **Dynamic Money Supply System**

**Core Features:**
- **Real-time Supply Adjustment**: Base supply increases with each burned XFG
- **Burn-Reborn Balance**: Reborn XFG automatically equals burned XFG
- **Economic Balance**: Maintains 8M8.8M8 base supply while tracking burns
- **Circulating Supply**: Total Supply - Locked Deposits (excluding burn deposits)

**Technical Implementation:**
- `DynamicMoneySupply` class with real-time state management
- `DepositIndex` integration for burned XFG tracking
- RPC endpoints: `getDynamicSupplyOverview`, `getCirculatingSupply`, `getTotalBurnedXfg`
- FOREVER deposits (term = 4294967295) for XFG-for-HEAT mints

**Economic Benefits:**
- Prevents inflation by mining only from actual available supply
- Enables redistribution through block rewards
- Maintains economic balance with automatic reborn mechanism

### 🎯 **Dynamic Ring Size (Enhanced Privacy)**

**Core Features:**
- **Adaptive Ring Sizing**: 18→15→12→11→10→9→8 (minimum)
- **Maximum Privacy**: Selects largest achievable ring size
- **Enhanced Privacy**: Minimum ring size 8 for BlockMajorVersion 10+
- **Smart Fallback**: Graceful degradation with optimizer guidance

**Privacy Levels:**
- **Ring Size 8**: Enhanced Privacy (minimum)
- **Ring Size 10**: Good Privacy
- **Ring Size 12**: Better Privacy
- **Ring Size 15**: Strong Privacy
- **Ring Size 18**: Maximum Privacy

**Technical Implementation:**
- `DynamicRingSizeCalculator` class with optimal size calculation
- Integration with `WalletTransactionSender`, `SimpleWallet`, `PaymentGateService`
- Automatic optimizer guidance for insufficient outputs
- Backward compatibility with older block versions

### ⚡ **Dynamic Multi-Window Difficulty Algorithm (DMWDA)**

**Core Features:**
- **Multi-Window Approach**: 15/45/120 blocks + 5-block emergency window
- **Emergency Response**: Rapid adaptation to 10x hash rate changes
- **Block Stealing Prevention**: Advanced anomaly detection and prevention
- **Confidence-Based Weighting**: Adaptive response based on network stability

**Algorithm Components:**
- **Short Window (15 blocks)**: Rapid response to immediate changes
- **Medium Window (45 blocks)**: Stability and current algorithm
- **Long Window (120 blocks)**: Trend analysis and long-term stability
- **Emergency Window (5 blocks)**: Crisis response to attacks

**Security Features:**
- **Solve Time Clamping**: ±10x target time limits prevent manipulation
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies suspicious mining patterns
- **Emergency Mode**: 0.1x to 10x adjustment range for crisis response
- **Statistical Analysis**: Detects and prevents block stealing attempts

---

## 🛡️ **Enhanced Security Features**

### **Block Stealing Prevention**
- Advanced detection algorithms for suspiciously fast blocks
- Emergency mode activation for hash rate attacks
- Statistical analysis for anomalous mining patterns
- Cumulative difficulty validation prevents fake timestamps

### **Anti-Manipulation Measures**
- Solve time clamping with ±10x target time limits
- Confidence scoring based on coefficient of variation
- Adaptive bounds that change based on network stability
- Smoothing algorithms prevent oscillations

## 📊 **Comprehensive Testing Suite**

### **DMWDA Test Suite**
- **8 Comprehensive Test Scenarios**:
  1. Normal Operation (200 blocks, stable timing)
  2. Hash Rate Spike (10x increase with recovery)
  3. Hash Rate Drop (10x decrease with recovery)
  4. Block Stealing Attempt (consecutive fast blocks)
  5. Oscillating Hash Rate (alternating fast/slow)
  6. Gradual Hash Rate Change (smooth transition)
  7. Edge Cases (boundary conditions)
  8. Stress Test (1000 blocks, random timing)

- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Stability Score (0-10): Target > 7.0 for normal operation
  - Response Time: < 10 blocks for most scenarios
  - Emergency Activations: Appropriate for scenario
  - Block Stealing Detection: 100% detection rate

### **Dynamic Supply Simulation**
- 6-month simulation with 1 million XFG burned
- Economic balance verification
- Reborn block reward analysis
- Long-term stability testing
- Max supply stays 8M8
