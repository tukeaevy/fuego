# Adaptive Multi-Window Difficulty Algorithm (AMWDA)

## Overview

The Adaptive Multi-Window Difficulty Algorithm (AMWDA) is Fuego's next-generation difficulty adjustment system, designed to address the limitations of traditional difficulty algorithms. It activates at **BlockMajorVersion 10** (height 969696) alongside the Enhanced Privacy features.

## Key Features

### üöÄ **Fast Adaptation**
- **Multi-window approach**: Uses 3 different time windows (15, 45, 120 blocks)
- **Emergency response**: 5-block window for sudden hash rate changes
- **Confidence-based weighting**: Adapts response speed based on network stability

### üõ°Ô∏è **Block Stealing Prevention**
- **Solve time clamping**: Prevents manipulation of individual block times
- **Anomaly detection**: Identifies suspicious mining patterns
- **Emergency mode**: Rapid response to hash rate attacks

### üìä **Large Swing Handling**
- **Adaptive bounds**: Adjustment limits change based on network confidence
- **Smoothing**: Prevents oscillations during volatile periods
- **Trend analysis**: Long-term window provides stability

## Technical Implementation

### **Multi-Window Architecture**

```
Short Window (15 blocks)  ‚Üí Rapid Response
Medium Window (45 blocks) ‚Üí Stability & Current Algorithm
Long Window (120 blocks)  ‚Üí Trend Analysis
Emergency Window (5 blocks) ‚Üí Crisis Response
```

### **Algorithm Components**

#### **1. LWMA Calculation**
- **Linear Weighted Moving Average** for each window
- **Recent blocks weighted higher** for responsiveness
- **Clamped solve times** prevent manipulation

#### **2. Confidence Scoring**
- **Coefficient of variation** analysis
- **Lower variance = higher confidence**
- **Adaptive weighting** based on network stability

#### **3. Emergency Detection**
```cpp
// Detect 10x hash rate changes
if (recentTime < expectedTime / 10 || recentTime > expectedTime * 10) {
    emergencyMode = true;
}
```

#### **4. Adaptive Bounds**
- **High confidence**: 0.5x to 4.0x adjustment range
- **Low confidence**: 0.8x to 2.0x adjustment range
- **Emergency mode**: 0.1x to 10.0x adjustment range

## Comparison with Previous Algorithms
